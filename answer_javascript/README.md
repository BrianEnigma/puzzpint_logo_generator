#Puzzled Pint Answer Form Javascript

A basic HTML form with JavaScript for entering a location puzzle answer and redirecting to the appropriate page.

Normally I separate HTML from JavaScript and CSS, but because this is meant to be pasted into a CMS, I ended up using inline styles and JavaScript in the same file. That way, the whole thing can (presumably?) be pasted into a single content area in the CMS.
